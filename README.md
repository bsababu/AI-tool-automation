# AI-Powered Computational Infrastructure Configuration Tool

## Overview

Accessing computational infrastructures is becoming increasingly complex, requiring significant manual effort to configure platforms efficiently. This project introduces an AI-powered tool that automates the configuration of computing platforms, optimizing resource allocation and reducing setup time for research projects.

### Key Features

- Automated Configuration: Leverages AI to automate the setup of computing environments, reducing manual intervention.

- Resource Optimization: Aligns computational, networking, and storage resources with specific project needs.

- Research Paper Analysis: Analyzes research papers to determine optimal configurations.

- Source Code Integration: Extracts relevant configurations from repositories like GitHub to streamline deployments.

- API & Script Integration: Provides API access or auto-generated scripts for easy integration and deployment.

- Scalability & Efficiency: Enhances scalability, allowing researchers to focus on their work rather than infrastructure management.

### Technical Requirements

To build and deploy this tool, the following technologies are required:

- Conversational AI: Enables intelligent interaction and decision-making for resource allocation.

- Databases: Stores configuration details, user preferences, and research data for adaptive learning.

- Python: Core programming language for developing AI models, APIs, and automation scripts.
